## Quickstart

```
# Basic Python environment required. For example:
# apt update && apt install -y --no-install-recommends git python3 python3-pip python3-venv

git clone https://github.com/scottyeager/peppermint.git

cd peppermint
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate # Choose .fish for fish shell
pip install python-fasthtml requests grid3

python3 main.py
```

A link to visit the dev server will appear in your terminal.

## Deploy

FastHTML ships with Uvicorn, which is used for the development server when executing `main.py` directly.

For production, it's best to disable the websocket based live code reloading and use a bit more robust configuration. A number of options are discussed [here](https://www.uvicorn.org/deployment/). The built in process manager is what I'll show below.

Use a `config.py` file to disable live code reloading:

```
echo "LIVE_RELOAD = False" > config.py
```

Then run it:

```
source .venv/bin/activate
uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --workers 1
```

That's for HTTP only. To enable HTTPS via a reverse proxy, such as Caddy, binding to a different port on localhost might be preferred.
